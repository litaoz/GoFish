Goal: GoFish

Rules of the game:
Players start off with seven cards.
Each player takes turns asking for a card that's in their hand.
If the other player has one or more of that rank card, they must give all of it.
If the other player doesn't have any of that rank card, player must draw a card from deck.
Having all four cards of a rank creates a "set".
The player with the most sets in the end wins.

Downloaded GitHub for the first time, and attempted to sort out all the configuration.
Mostly just followed what was prompted of me.
1/26/14
Finished writing a version of GoFish.
Includes features as turning on and off all the print statements.


Plans:
-Fix up the user interface in terms of words.
-Design more P2 algorithms:
	-Pick cards in ascending order so that all the cards can be chosen once 
	before they are chosen again.
	-Never pick doubles. Record stolen doubles and always take stolen doubles.
-GUI. Definitely want it to be out of console.
-Maybe connect to skype?
